Remaster of old project

### Some future plans about this project

1. Make working preloader. window.onload doesn't work right by now.
2. Understand when webpack need require import for images in index.html.
3. Button 'Saving...' in placePopup works only like decorative function. Not good.
4. In 5-10% amount of page starts you can see black page, and need to refresh page. 
5. Understand work of removeEventListener in classes and binding function.
